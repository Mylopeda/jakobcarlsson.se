Learning to code in the 1990's I have a lot of experience from code in different ways.
In the beginning it was Pascal and then it went on to Java, Perl, PHP, ASP (vbscript) and many other languages through the years. Learning more and more languages through the years has helped me to keep many tools in my toolbox. Learning new programming languages is part of what I do.

I see programming languages, design patterns, architectures, text editors and so on as tools in a toolbox, when we start to build something new we try to pick the tools that we feel are the best to solve the specific problem, be it C#, Perl, PHP or just a simple bash script, it doesn't matter.

I might spend most of my days today building solutions in C# but that doesn't say that I don't like building things in Go, Java, Perl or other languages. Most things I build today run in Microsoft Azure but it's the same thing here, I work with all clouds and try to find the best one for the solution at the place where we are building it. On-prem is also an option when the problem requires it.

I started my professional career doing both development and operations for a course portal at Lund University. This gave me a good solid ground to stand on when it comes to both software development and operations. I have since added more to both sides when adopting devops as a philosophy and also taking on both sides of that coin, doing both development and operations in the cloud with Infrastructure as Code and so on.

During my later years I have started to get an interest in not only working with code, operations and the technical architecture but also working on how people work together when building the solutions. Building teams at different customers through the years, helping other developers move forward, giving the other team members challenges to help them forward and so on. I have found great pleasure in sitting down with junior developers and helping them to find the answer to their questions, moving more and more to coaching them to find the answers themselves than just giving it to them.

At the moment I work at a swedish company called [Strategic 9](https://strategic9.se/), solving the problems of our customers together with my colleagues.

I have also started doing some public speaking about different topics that I come across at work or when thinking about different things. If you want me to come and speak about something, don't be afraid to reach out.
