On one project, we proudly designed a “flexible” microservices architecture. Every capability was extracted, every interaction decoupled, every team autonomous. On paper it was beautiful. In reality, a simple user request bounced through eight services, three message queues, and two data stores before returning a response.

Technically, everything worked. Architecturally, we had built a maze. The system wasn’t hard to scale — it was hard to understand. What was missing wasn’t another pattern or technology, but a moment of honest reflection: *Who is this complexity really serving?*

## Why Reflection Matters

Most developers never get the time to reflect on what they are building, we are rushing deadlines, forcing "user stories" to be closed at the end of "sprints", often switching context, a pressure to deliver and so on and so on. It's not strange that the developers of today find very little time to reflect on what they are actually doing. The quick and easy to write solution might feel good at the moment, but if we had spent a bit more time on it we could perhaps have saved hours and in some cases days when running large amounts of data.
