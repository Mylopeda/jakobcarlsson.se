I was driving in my car when the radio started playing Satchmo's "What a Wonderful World" and one of the lines caught my attention, "They'll learn much more than I'll ever know". He is referring to the babies that he heard crying and watched grow.

When we acknowledge that the next generation will surpass our knowledge, we are acknowledging the world's evolution. They won't just memorize what we know; they will replace our knowledge with something more adapted to their time.

Evolution might not always be "good" by our current (or future) standards. It is simply movement. But that movement is vital. For the world to stop evolving is for the world to stagnate, and in nature, stagnation is death.

The world is evolving, even if it doesn't always look like it.
