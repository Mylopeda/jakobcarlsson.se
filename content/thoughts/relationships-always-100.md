Being in a romantic relationship with somebody is always 100%, but this is not you investing 100% in the relationship but rather the relationship being 100%.

On the best of days you are both giving 50% + 50% and living a happy life. Some days it might be 70% + 30% and some days it might even be 90% + 10%.

The trick is seeing the sum and not the individual parts. Not saying "I give more than you".

We are not there to compete with each other but to live together, and sometimes life happens and the balance shifts from the best of 50% + 50%.

It's on the days where the balance is shifted that the relationship matters the most.
